lets understand with card example

let's say there are 4 cards :

numbers in them = {5,2,6,9}

now sort them assuming them in ur hand

first 5 ->hold it<br>
then 2 -> its less than 5 so it comes before it<br>
then 6 -> 5+ so add accordingly<br>
sort them like it

<hr>
Inserion sort = inserting elements accordingly

let's say arr = {1,10,7,4,8,2,11}

round 1:
{1,10,7,4,8,2,11} 1 fixed

round 2:
{1,7,10,4,8,2,11} 

round 3:
{1,4,7,10,8,2,11}

round 4:
{1,4,7,8,10,2,11}

round 5:
{1,2,4,7,8,10,11}
