<h3>NOTE : IT IS A BAD PRACTICE NEVER USE IT!!</h3>
<p>reason : it's value can be updated anywhere which is bad</p><br>
<p>used when we want to share variables b/w functions</p>
<h3>Syntax:</h3>
<p>same as defining normal variables but we define them on top</p><br>
<p>#include<iostream></p><br>
<p>using namespace std</p><br>
<br>
<p>int var = 12</p><br>
<p>rest of the code as normal</p>
