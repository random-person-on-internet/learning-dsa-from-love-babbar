<h3>#include <iostream></h3>
as we know, it adds all files from iostream to our program
<br>
<h3>#define</h3>
<p>this tag is used to add values with global scope</p><br>
<p>#define pi 3.14</p><br>
<p>using normal double pi = 3.14; does a VERY MINOR performance hit</p><br>
<p>Hence, it is preferred to use macros instead</p><br>
<p>NOTE: macros can't be changes</p>
<p>Extra features through examples: </p><br>
<p>AREA (l , b) (l * b)</p> there's no need of "="<br>
<p>we use ",\" for new lines</p>
